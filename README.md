# 📌 Student Attendance System (API-Based | C Language)

The Student Attendance System is a full-stack academic project developed using C language for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The project demonstrates API-based client–server communication using HTTP without using any database, JSON, or external server software such as XAMPP.
The system allows teachers to mark student attendance through a web-based interface and view stored attendance records. Attendance data is sent to a C-based backend server using HTTP POST requests and stored locally using file handling techniques. A GET API endpoint is used to fetch and display all attendance records.
